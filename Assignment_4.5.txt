Perform the below operations:
1. Compute the measures of central tendency for salary and reduction which variable has highest center?

Solution:

library(RcmdrPlugin.IPSUR)
RcmdrTestDrive
# Histogram of salary shows bell shaped symetric distribution so the best measure of center should be the mean
hist(RcmdrTestDrive$salary)
# Histogram of reduction shows right skewed distribution so the best measure of center should be median
hist(RcmdrTestDrive$reduction)
# Finding the Mean of salary & Median of reduction
mean(RcmdrTestDrive$salary)
median(RcmdrTestDrive$reduction)


Compairing both salary and reduction, salary has the highest center



2. Which measure of center is more appropriate for before and after?

Solution:

# By plotting the histogram we can check the distribution
# Bell shaped symmetric distribution for before we need to calculate mean
hist(RcmdrTestDrive$before)
mean(RcmdrTestDrive$before)

# Left skewed symmetric distribution for after we need to calcualte medain
hist(RcmdrTestDrive$after)
median(RcmdrTestDrive$after)
